### Self-introduction
*****
MORIMOTO Yukihiro is Mastar's student of Osaka Prefecture University, belong to  Graduate School of Humanities and Sustainable System sciences. <br>
My majars are Experimental Psychology & cognitive Psychology. My research theme is association between subjective consciousness (or Awareness) and behavior.<br>
I am mainly interested in various information processing in the human mind,and in particular,I want to explore the process and function of consciousness. <br>
My Supervisor is Dr MAKIOKA Shogo.<br><br>
I am currently a student member of Japanese Society for Cognitive Psychology and the Japanese Cognitive Science Society.<br>
The specific content of the current study is to present visual stimuli, measure response time and PAS (Perceptual Awareness Scale), and verify how primer visibility affects the response to the target. <br><br>

The experiment environment is mainly on Linux OS Ubuntu, and the experiment is configured using MATLAB and Psychtoolbox-3.Currently, I measure the reaction time using a keyboard and joystick, but in the future, I plan to use various devices (For example Motion capture system) and brain waves for measurement.<br>
The analysis mainly uses  ANOVA, linear mixed model analysis, and general linear mixed model by analysisstatistical software R, but is currently studying to use Bayesian statistics.Recently, I'm also studying python, mainly for data visualization and graphing.<br>

I am interested in experimental methods and theories, as well as data analysis methods, the construction of new experimental environments,and the sharing of research data and interpretations.<br>

### Essay (update:12th October 2019)
*****
I've only lived with the Japanese language, but I made a self-introduction site in English to connect to the world.<br>
My ugly English is difficult to read, but thank you for visiting the website.If you have the improvement of the homepage,and any questions about research content, or comments, please email me.
